# Twig Pattern Library

This repo will contain multiple modules that will work together and the folder structure will be inspired by [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages) approach to the [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).

For now, just head into `twig-pl-core/` and treat it like the single module.
